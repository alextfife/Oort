# Oort (dot) webs (dot) com
In 2013 I made a website with my friends for us and our classmates to access frequently needed websites and info. Our school issued us laptops so everyone had work to do on it, and could access it. My school: https://chs.nwfsc.edu/

This was more than 10 years ago, but who doesnt like to see where we began?

# Notables
- Many concepts didnt make it to the light of day. For example, we tried to implement a client side javascript calendar/planner into the site. 
- We had comments, they may or may not populate here. We are not responsible for anything posted there. Furthermore, if there is an oddly placed item in any page, you might've found the comments section.

# Design
- I had most of the creative control of the site, and I was hugely inspired by iOS 7. 
- The web app was a huge thing for me because most of our peers and ourselves had smartphones so I beleive having mobile and dynamic views was extremely important.
