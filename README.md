# Oort (dot) webs (dot) com
In 2013 I made a website with my friends for us and our classmates to access frequently needed websites and info. Our school issued us laptops so everyone had work to do on it, and could access it. My school: https://chs.nwfsc.edu/

This was more than 10 years ago, but who doesnt like to see where we began? 

# Authors
- Animations: Nathan Smith
- Content: Thomas Anchor
- iOS app & styling: Alex Fife 

# Notables
- Many concepts didnt make it to the light of day. For example, we tried to implement a client side javascript calendar/planner into the site. 
- We had comments, they may or may not populate here. We are not responsible for anything posted there. Furthermore, if there is an oddly placed item in any page, you might've found the comments section.

# Design
- I had most of the creative control of the site, and I was hugely inspired by iOS 7. 

# Screenshots

Home page (elements under the banner picture were hoverable. I was very insistent in using CSS float and not making users scroll for information)

Developers page: gotta let everyone know who did it!

'App' page - The web app was a huge thing for me because most of our peers and ourselves had smartphones so I believe having mobile and dynamic views was extremely important.
